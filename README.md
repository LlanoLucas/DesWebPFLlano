This is my Web Dev Project, using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and SCSS. I tried to emulate a business type of website, using courses as the main topic.

In my SASS files I wanted to organize everything as much as I could, using kind of the 7-1 architecture pattern. So I first made a folder for the SCSS files, and then separated some other folders inside to make it all cleaner and work in specific files. Such ass scss/layout/nav for example.
Also I used some mixins for the @media screen, so it would be easier to make my styles in different breakpoints, and for some specific styles, like gradients and border gradients. The same with variables, made one for every color I used in the site.

Respecting to the SEO I made sure every img had its own alt="", added to the "head" the corresponding "meta"s, every page has its own "description", "keywords" and of course "title". And also I tried to use as much semantic tags as I could, to make the code be more easy to read and more organized.

The page is completly responsive, using mostly relative units, and when no needed absolute units, of course also using flexbox and grid. To make sure the site was completly responsive I even made 4 different breakpoints so that nothing breaks.

I hope you like this project!
